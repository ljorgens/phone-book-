READ ME!
Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my phone_book project and my sinatra website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs: I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1 and the text editor Sublime text 2 along with the terminal using ruby 1.9.2 and Safari web browser

Create a folder called phone_book and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a word_count folder with three folders and two files (not including the README). Make sure Lib and spec have two files and views has 3 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to open the terminal (make sure you are in the word_count folder) and download the gems: Sinatra Sinatra-contrib Sinatra/reloader bundler

then type bundle in your terminal. Now type $ ruby app.rb in your terminal. This will open Sinatra and You are ready to go!

Next open your browser and type in local:4567 and the home page should come up. And thats it play with the project to your hearts content!
